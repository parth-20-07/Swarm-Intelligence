# Introduction

The aim of the course is to learn Basics of Foundation which includes topics like:

- DH Parameters
- ROS2 Humble
- Jacobian
- Forward and Inverse Kinematics
- Sensors and Systems
- Probablistic Robotics

Each Assignment shown here has a detailed explaination in its own directory. Please refer the individual directories for in-depth explaination of how the code works.
