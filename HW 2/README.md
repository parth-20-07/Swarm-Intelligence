# Introduction

The aim of the assignment is to understand the networks by taking into accounts the human psychology and behavioural patterns observed.

**Networks** are collections of entities connected by link.

**Graphs**

- **Graphs** are models of networks.
- A graph is a set of **nodes** connected by **edges**.
- Two nodes are **neighbors** if they are connected by one edge.

# Triadic Closure

**Mark Granovetter** observed during his PdD that people while finding for new jobs found about new jobs from acquaintances, not closed friends. For social networks,

*If two people in a social network have a friend in common,then there is an increased likelihood that they will become friends themselves at some point in the future.*

This principle is called **triadic closure**.

# Strong and Weak Ties

To make sense of Granovetter's findings, a new concept of **strength** of an edge is introduced.

- **Strong Tie** corresponds to a close friendship.
- **Weak Tie** corresponds to an acquaintance.

If a node **A** has edges to nodes **B** and **C**,then the **B−C** edge is **especially likely** to form if A’s edges to B and C are both **strong ties**.

# Betweenness

We define the  **betweenness** of an edge to be the total amount of flow it carries, counting flow between all pairs of nodes using this edge.
